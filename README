This is a website template I've been working on and I need help adding a few things and making sure that there are no bugs.
The thing I'm having most trouble with is my slideshow. I want the images to fit with width of the brower without loosing quality, and all of them have to fit the height of the slidshow. One of the biggest things I need is for the images to be responive to broswer size.
